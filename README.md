# Elixir Training

**Description**

These are a bunch of different algorithms made on Elixir language.

I made this project because I wanted to learn Elixir by implementing different algorithms. I'm still doing it so bear with me if you find any bad practice here.

I also wanted to learn TDD by using ExUnit, so you will find all of the tests that I did before. Add your own if you want.

Please, if you wanna contribute to this repository with your own algorithms, situations and use cases you can fork it and do a pull request. Note that I will accept pull request which algorithms has unit tests and are well documented.

You can also be free to create your own modules. The should also be documented, please.

The aim of the project was also to have a reference for situations and use cases that I can inspect in case I'd have to do something similar on other project. I hope it benefits you in the same way than me.

Hope you enjoy it.

## Installation

```elixir
mix deps.get
```

for adding dependencies that I used to generate documentation
